# SpotifyAPIConsumption
## A Spotify Interface clone that consumes the Spotify API for showing results of searches, your playlists, your top played songs and some music suggestions based on your current musical taste
## I'm also planning to program music playback on the webpage itself or at least being able to control another device that is currently playing the music (through the Spotify's API), but this will come later
The inspiration for this project came from the event "Imers√£o Front-end Alura" made by Alura and my interest for learning the subject of APIs in web development
I wish a Happy Coding for you & me, Thanks!
